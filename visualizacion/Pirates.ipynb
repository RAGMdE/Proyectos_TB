    "Global Maritime Pirate Attacks (1993-2020) Exploratory Data Cleaning and Analysis\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "Piracy and robbery against ships is a modern day challange for international trade and commerce. In this analysis, I will clean and analyze the data to answer some key questions I have come up with to indetify how to better prepare for these events.\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "The US Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration has come to me with questions to direct their future trade endeavors. They have been collecting data on piracy attacks since 1993 and are trying to predict if a boarding attack is more likely to happen. They have asked me to put together a model showing them how certain data they recieve can help predict when attacks will occur so they may make better decisions on trade routes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Date [Key] - Date of Attack. Used as a key with the Country Matrix data frame.\n",
    "Time - Time the attack took place, either in UTC or Local Time.\n",
    "Longitude - Longitude where the attack took place.\n",
    "Latitude - Latitude where the attack took place.\n",
    "Attack Type - Either NA (Missing), Attempted, Boarding, or Hijacked.\n",
    "Location Description - A text description of the location. With attacks taking place at sea, it is not as simple as just       naming a city or town.\n",
    "Nearest Country [Key] - The country code whose shore is closest to the attack. The resolution is around 1 km, it can be         much better depending on how detailed the mapping of the coast is in the vicinity.\n",
    "EEZ Country [Key] - The Exclusive Economic Zone country code in which the attack took place, if it took place within an         EEZ.\n",
    "Shore Distance - Distance in kilometres to the shore from the attack location. This is the true geographic distance over       the surface of the earth.\n",
    "Shore Longitude - The longitude of the closest point on the shore to the attack.\n",
    "Shore Latitude - The latitude of the closest point on the shore to the attack.\n",
    "Attack Description - The text description of the attack if it exists.\n",
    "Vessel Name - The name of the ship which was attacked if it is known.\n",
    "Vessel Type - The type of vessel attacked if known.\n",
    "Vessel Status - The status of the ship at the time it was attacked. Either NA (Missing), Berthed (Tied to a berth), Anchored (anchored at sea or in a harbour), or Steaming (ship underway).\n",

    "\n",
    "Country [Key] - The country in ISO3 country code format.\n",
    "Corruption Index - Corruption Perceptions Index.\n",

    "Total Military - Total Number of Armed Forces personnel.\n",
    "Population - Country Population.\n",
    "Unemployment Rate - Percentage of the Country Unemployed.\n",
    "Total GR - Total Government Revenue. An indication of how well the country collects taxes.\n",
    "Industry - Industrial contribution to total GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "country_codes.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Country [Key] - The country in ISO3 country code format.\n",
    "Region - The region the country is in.\n",
    "Country Name - The English country name.\n",
    "Key Variables\n",
    "Country - How the datasets will be joined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longitude and Latitude - This could be used for creating a map visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time - When are events most frequentley occuring?\n",
    "\n",
    "Shore Distance - Does distance to shore have a strong effect on probability of an event occuring?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vessel Status - How does the probability of an event occuring change based on status?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can using these country indicators tell us something about which countries to avoid when creating trade routes? Do these countries look similar to the logitude and latitude where attacks are frequent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Corruption Index , Homicide Rate , GPD , Total Fisheries Per Ton , Total Military , Population , Unemployment Rate , Total GR , Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Questions\n",
    "1) What variables have the highest impact on probability of an attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Has there been an increase in attacks in certain areas? How about an increase overall?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Do variables associated with countries have an affect on their safety in terms of maritime trade?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Has the frequency of different types of attacks increased or decreased over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Is it common to have an ally close by where attacks are frequent? This could be useful if the US decides to be a bit riskier and go around areas frequently attacked.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) To prepare our sailors, what Vessel Status is most likely to be hit by an attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Is there value in creating a continous model to advise the administration on what course of action to take? Does the data provide the answers the Administration needs?\n",
